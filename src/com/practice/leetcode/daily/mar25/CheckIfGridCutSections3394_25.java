     * Interview Tip: In-Place Algorithms
     * In-place algorithms overwrite the input to save space, but sometimes this can cause problems.
     * Here are a couple of situations where an in-place algorithm might not be suitable:
     *
     * The algorithm needs to run in a multi-threaded environment without exclusive access to the array.
     * Other threads might need to read the array as well and may not expect it to be modified.
     * Even if there is only a single thread or the algorithm has exclusive access to the array while running,
     * the array might need to be reused later or by another thread once the lock has been released.
     * In an interview, always check whether the interviewer is okay with you overwriting the input.
     * Be prepared to explain the pros and cons of doing so if asked!
